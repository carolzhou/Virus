// Description : 
//    Qspp is an agent-based stochastic simulation model. Being a simplified
//    version of an original model plan, it contains only 3 agents:  genotypes,
//    populations, and the quasispecies cloud. This model could be expanded to a
//    full-scale, parallel in-cell/cell-to-cell model. I am calling this a
//    "transition model", as it models the Sabin to Mahoney genetic transition.
//    Sabin is an attenuated strain of poliovirus that was the basis for the
//    original polio vaccine. It is non-virulent, although it has potential to
//    mutate into a virulent state, specifically by means of reversion at any of
//    54 nucleotide positions distributed along the genome. Some of the nucleotide
//    differences between Sabin and Mahoney (the wide type) confer neurovirulence,
//    and thus are of particular interest.
//       This code simulates a cell-to-cell model of Poliovirus replication.
//    The model tracks genotypes (virus genomes) as they are replicated in cells, and
//    as the cells burst and release particles into the medium of a culture dish. An
//    inoculum is then taken from the pool of virions and used to inoculate cells on
//    a new dish.  This process repeates. The simulation is greatly simplified, as the
//    code models only the 54 positions that differ between the Sabin and Mahoney
//    strains, and the only cellular components are the genotypes. Various parameters
//    are controlled by the programmer (e.g., burst size, inoculum size, number of
//    generations). Genetic variability is achieved by random nucleotide mutation and
//    copy-choice replication. Indels are not modeled.  
//       Version 1 of this model is designed to simulate the transition from Sabin
//    to Mahoney. Thus, the Sabin genotype comprises the initial inoculum.
//    Nucleotide positions that match neurovirulence (from the literature)
//    are enumerated in FixedPosition.h. This current version, 1.2, implements
//    fitness, which is defined according to the neurovirulent Mahoney genotype.
//       The overall purpose of this model is to simulate the Sabin-to-Mahoney
//    transition and to study the genetic mechanisms that drive this transition.
//    This model can be used as a teaching tool for better understanding the
//    potential impact of changes in the frequencies of these known genetic
//    mechanisms.
